# Bikesharing

## OVERVIEW
We are exploring the idea of opening up CitiBike in Des Moines, Iowa. My friend, Kate, has a potential angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike-share program in Des Moines. In addition to Kate's proposal, I have the data analytics experience and will figure out how this project will actually work.
